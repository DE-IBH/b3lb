# B3LB - BigBlueButton Load Balancer

B3LB is a open source [BigBlueButton API](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/dev/api.html) load balancer similar to [Scalelite](https://github.com/blindsidenetworks/scalelite). B3LB is based on the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) Python Web framework and is designed to work in large scale-out deployments with 100+ BigBlueButton nodes and high attendee join rates. The project started at [IBH IT-Service GmbH](https://www.ibh.de/) in the fall 2020 and has been published in February 2021 during the second COVID-19 lock down in Germany.
